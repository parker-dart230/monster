        <h1>The Uninvited Guest</h1>
        <p>This is an uninvited guest that came to earth from an unknown area of the galaxy. It came to earth and made contact with a small house in the middle of nowwhere. The residence of the house are too scared to go outside while the alien creature uses its beam to look for whatever it would like t bring back home. Unfortunatly for him the human race on earth is much less advanced than his kind so he wont impress his alien friends with any cool and exciting stories or items brought back. On earth he was spotted on camera by some people who were intrigued but they were seen as crazy alien conscpiracist. He later flew away never to be seen again.  </p>
